        "(Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ ) said on Friday that its "
        "single-dose vaccine was 66% effective in preventing COVID-19 in a large "
        "global trial against multiple variants, giving health officials another "
        "weapon to tackle the pandemic. In the trial of nearly 44,000 volunteers, the "
        "level of protection against moderate and severe COVID-19 varied from 72% in "
        "the United States, to 66% in Latin America and just 57% in South Africa, "
        "from where a worrying variant has spread. The data showed that the vaccine's "
        "effect on the South Africa variant was diminished compared to the unaltered "
        "virus, but infectious disease and public health experts said it can still "
        "help contain the virus spread and prevent deaths. Midstage trial data from "
        "Novavax (NASDAQ: NVAX ) on Thursday also documented lower effectiveness in "
        "South Africa. Rival shots from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna (NASDAQ: MRNA ) "
        "were both around 95% effective in preventing symptomatic illness in pivotal "
        "trials when given in two doses. Those trials were conducted mainly in the "
        "United States and before the emergence of new variants. These mean that the "
        "world is racing against time and with limited supplies to vaccinate as many "
        "people as possible, and quickly, to prevent virus surges. COVID-19 is rising "
        "in 37 countries and infections have surpassed 101 million globally. Top U.S. "
        "infectious disease specialist Anthony Fauci said the world needs to "
        "vaccinate quickly to try to get ahead of these changes in the virus. \"It's "
        "really a wake up call for us to be nimble and to be able to adjust as this "
        "virus will continue for certain to evolve,\" Fauci said. J&J's main goal was "
        "the prevention of moderate to severe COVID-19, and the vaccine was 85% "
        "effective in stopping severe disease and preventing hospitalization across "
        "all geographies and against multiple variants 28 days after immunization. "
        'That "will potentially protect hundreds of millions of people from serious '
        "and fatal outcomes of COVID-19,\" Paul Stoffels, J&J's chief scientific "
        "officer, said. J&J shares were down 4% at $162.7 at 1700 GMT, with some Wall "
        "Street analysts saying its vaccine's effectiveness was below those of "
        "rivals. Moderna's stock gained 8% to $172.80. SEEKING APPROVAL J&J plans to "
        "seek emergency use authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration "
        "next week and will soon follow up with the European Union and the rest of "
        "the world. It has said it plans to deliver 1 billion doses of the vaccine, "
        "which it will make in the United States, Europe, South Africa and India, in "
        "2021. Public health officials are counting on it to increase much-needed "
        "supply and simplify immunization in the United States, which has a deal to "
        "buy 100 million doses of J&J's vaccine and an option for an additional 200 "
        "million. J&J said the vaccine would be ready immediately upon emergency "
        'approval, but Stoffels declined to say how many doses. "The key is not only '
        "overall efficacy but specifically efficacy against severe disease, "
        'hospitalization, and death," said Walid Gellad, a health policy associate '
        "professor at the University of Pittsburgh. J&J's vaccine uses a common cold "
        "virus to introduce coronavirus proteins into cells and trigger an immune "
        "response, whereas the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines employ a new "
        "technology called messenger RNA. Unlike these vaccines, J&J's does not "
        "require a second shot weeks after the first or need to be kept frozen, "
        "making it a strong candidate for use in parts of the world where "
        'transportation and cold storage present problems. "Most countries are still '
        "desperate to get their hands on doses, regardless of whether or not the "
        "vaccine is considered highly effective. Moderately effective will do just "
        'fine for now," Michael Breen, Director of Infectious Diseases and '
        "Ophthalmology at research firm GlobalData, said. 'OVERWHELMED' Several "
        "studies have emerged this month showing that a South African variant has "
        "mutated in areas of the virus that are key targets of vaccines, reducing "
        'their efficacy. "What we are learning is there is different efficacy in '
        'different parts of the world," Stoffels told Reuters. In a sub-study of '
        "6,000 volunteers in South Africa, Stoffels said, the J&J vaccine was 89% "
        "effective at preventing severe disease. In the South Africa portion of the "
        'trial, 95% of cases were infections with the South African variant. "I am '
        "overwhelmed by the fact that this vaccine protected against severe disease "
        'even in South Africa," said Glenda Gray, the joint lead investigator of the '
        "South African vaccine trial. In the J&J trial, which was conducted in eight "
        "countries, 44% of participants were from the United States, 41% from Central "
        "and South America and 15% from South Africa. Just over a third of the "
        "volunteers were over 60."
