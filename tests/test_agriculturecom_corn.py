        "the overall stress tolerance of hybrids, and high plant populations do represent a "
        "type of stress.\nBob Nielsen is an agronomy professor at Purdue University . He "
        'says their research is showing that corn eventually reaches a plateau.\n"At the '
        "lower side, as you increase populations you get a pretty strong yield response. But "
        "as the population gets closer and closer to the optimum, the yield response begins to "
        'taper off, and ultimately it just basically plateaus," he says. "And once you reach '
        "the optimum agronomic population, adding more plants simply does not increase yield, "
        'and at some point, will actually decrease yield."\nBecause those last '
        "thousand-seeds-per-acre-or-so result in so few bushels, the economic optimum ends up "
        'being less than the agronomic optimum.\n"Our agronomic optimum, for example '
        'throughout much of Indiana, is a final stand of somewhere around 32,000," he says. '
        '"But because of that response curve and with grain prices being what they are and '
        "feed costs being what they are, our economic optimum tends to be below 30,"
        '000 for many of our soils here in Indiana."\nKnowing the history of successful '
        "stand establishments allows you to convert plant populations to seeding rates. "
        "Nielsen says with todayâ€™s planter technologies and seed quality, aiming for a percent "
        "stand of no less than 95% is a realistic goal."
