        " That is because the Oct 16, 2020 $7.50 Call had some of the highest implied volatility"
        " of all equity options today. What is Implied Volatility? Implied volatility shows how "
        "much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied "
        "volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one"
        " direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may"
        " cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of "
        "the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy. What do the Analysts Think?"
        " Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Waitr shares, but what is the "
        "fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Waitr is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the "
        "Internet - Software industry that ranks in the Bottom 31% of our Zacks Industry Rank. "
        "Over the last 60 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the "
        "current quarter, while one analyst has revised the estimate downward. The net effect has "
        "taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 4 cents per share to 3 "
        "cents in that period. Given the way analysts feel about Waitr right now, this huge "
        "implied volatility could mean there\u2019s a trade developing. Oftentimes, "
        "options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. "
        "This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, "
        "the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as "
        "originally expected. Looking to Trade Options? Check out the simple yet high-powered "
        "approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and "
        "triple-digit winners. In addition to impressive profit potential, these trades can "
